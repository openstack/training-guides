   The OpenStack Upstream Institute session in Denver is going to be

   preparation steps in the `OpenStack Upstream Institute Trainees' Guide
   <https://docs.openstack.org/upstream-training/upstream-trainees-guide.html>`_

.. note::
   If you are attempting the steps above in the week before the OpenStack
   Upstream Institute class and need assistance you can find mentors in the
   #openstack-upstream-institute channel on irc.freenode.net.

   There will also be office hours from 4 to 6 pm at the Former Saint
