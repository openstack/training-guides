OpenStack Upstream Training Archives
====================================

We held the first OpenStack Upstream Training in Atlanta,
before OpenStack Summit Atlanta 2014.
Since Atlanta, we have held the training before every OpenStack Summit.
Besides this "official" event, some user groups hold the local
Upstream trainings.

A big thank you to everyone that has made this possible, especially
Loic Dachary, Stefano Maffulli, Tim Freund, Marton Kiss, and Ildikó Váncsa
who lead the trainings.

Archived exercises
==================


Lego applied to Free Software contributions (15 min)
----------------------------------------------------

These slides prepare students for the Lego activity, and ensure they
understand the metaphors in use. The Lego in the exercise represents the
code of a software project, in this case OpenStack. The students all take
on roles that represent various facets of the OpenStack community, including
upstream roles like Foundation and TC, and contributors like corporations,
and unaffiliated individuals animated by unknown motives (free agents).

The group is split into their new 'teams' at this stage. Facilitators can
choose any way they prefer to do this (selecting teams, or allowing students
to self-select). The recommended numbers are in the slides, but can be
changed to suit the number of participants in the room. For a very large
group, consider separating into two 'communities', which then have to
fit their streets together to complete the session. Having more
communities requires an extra level of coordination to reach
`interoperability` between the results of their work.

Give each person a nametag to wear, with their first name and their
role written on it. For free agents, don't disclose who is distracted,
controversial, or agreeable. The community will need to work this out
on their own.

Contribution Simulation (2 hour)
--------------------------------

Ahead of time: ensure the existing Lego buildings are set out on a table,
but not connected to each other. All the unsorted bricks should be available
in several smaller boxes in a different part of the room, for participants
to use. There is no need to display the boxes or instruction manuals.

Once the students are separated into their new roles, and have an
understanding of the project, begin the timer for the first sprint. During
the five minutes planning time, encourage each group to get together and
think about their project. If possible, give each group a corner of the room
and access to a whiteboard or flipchart. For companies, ensure the CEO sets
a direction, and the team is on board. Their responsibility is to
deliver value to their stakeholders. For upstream, have them think about
the community standards they want to set: they are responsible for the
quality of the finished product. For free agent contributors,
use this time to get them to understand their role in the simulation:
explain their part as agents of chaos. They can get straight to work
as soon as they understand their role, no need to wait for the timer
to go off. The free agents should not be forced to coordinate among
themselves: there are better results if they find out how hard it is
to accomplish anything without coordinating with others. In theory,
the free agents can decide to demolish things, too: try suggesting
this option to one of them, see what happens.

Suggestions of projects to work on:

* Companies: big industrial items like a shopping mall, carpark, energy
  plant, datacenter, and hospital.

* Free agents: community items like vegetable patches, bicycle paths,
  public artworks, playgrounds. For the controversial agent, problematic
  items such as a jail, skate bowl, and dog park.

* Upstream: consider guidelines around consistency in the bricks used, how to
  connect the road and sidewalk between the buildings, the kinds of
  buildings they should request the community to make, and the things they
  simply will not accept. Make them understand that they are
  responsible for the finished product.

Start the timer for building time, and allow everyone to start work. During
each building phase, have mentors wander around the groups listening in and
making suggestions, without actually doing any of the work or giving
answers. The role of the mentors is to ask questions to orient the
conversations among the teams. For example, during the first sprint it
is common that the CEO and the PTL will face incompatibility of their
plans. Mentors should ask the teams how to address those issues.

In your interactions with the students, do not be afraid to provoke some
issues. For example, bring up the idea of an API (a way of connecting the
buildings to each other) with individual companies, but don't mention it
to upstream, so that upstream are finally faced with the challenge of
standardizing the API. You could also, in the second or third sprint,
encourage one group to call for a meeting off the sprint cycle to sort
the problem out.

During the final five minutes of the sprint (review time), ask everyone to
take their hands off the Lego, and gather around the in-progress street. At
this stage, upstream get to vote on the changes, and anything rejected gets
sent back to the contributing group to be fixed. Ensure upstream give good
reasons for rejections, along with suggestions for improvement. Encourage
Upstream to reject a few things early on, to try and ensure contributors
understand the need to have Foundation on board before they throw something
over the wall.

At the end of the four sprints, ensure you take a group photo!

Contribution Planning (2 hours)
-------------------------------

* The students prepare a 5-minute presentation of their planned contribution.
* Each student group prepares a presentation describing:

  * the contribution they plan to work on during the online sessions
  * how they will engage with the Upstream
  * how it contributes to the company's agenda
  * and whom they will be working with

* Each student group presents its slides to the class
