.. tip:: Slides are made with `Hieroglyph <http://hieroglyph.io>`_.
   To skim through slides quickly to find something, or jump ahead or back,
   use *Slide table* (press :command:`t` in the browser). Some slides
   include additional explanation in the *Presenter notes* (press
   :command:`c` to see them).

.. note::
   Most of the course content is being moved to `the Contributor Guide
   <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_. In the future, all
   that will live here are exercises that accompany the Guide.
