Create two new stories. Each story must have a task that is named
differently than the story and a project is required for each task
to save the story. Click save!

Play around with them - add tags, add extra tasks.

Create a board with at least two worklists (one manual and one automatic)
for organizing stories you are going to create in the next exercise.

story tag, etc.
